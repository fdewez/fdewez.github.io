Welcome !

I am a Mathematician in optimisation, data science and mathematical physics.<br />

Since February 2019, I have been working at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/), first as a postdoctoral researcher and research engineer until May 2021 in the [MODAL Team](https://team.inria.fr/modal/) and since then as a Starting Research Position in the [DataShape Team](https://team.inria.fr/datashape/).

### Research interest

* Methodologies exploiting statistical and learning methods for the modelling of optimisation problems
* Stationary phase methods with applications to the study of the propagation of wave packets
* Numerical methods for the decomposition of matrices depending continuously on a parameter and applications to sound source reconstruction
* Ciphertext-only attacks for the Hill cipher

**Keywords:** Machine learning, (trajectory) optimisation, oscillatory integral, dispersive equations, singular value decomposition, inverse problems in acoustics, Hill cipher
