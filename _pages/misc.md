I am interested in the popularisation of Mathematics. With Thibault Defourneau and Valentin Montmirail, we propose an intuitive modelling of the Lights Out game which has served for the creation of workshops and talks for high-school students.

## Lights Out

### Description

The Lights Out game consists of a 5 by 5 grid of lights. Given a pattern of switched lights, the goal of the game is to switch all the lights off with the following rule: pressing a light will toggle it and the adjacent ones. While being simple to explain, it turns out to be hard to solve in practice without an efficient strategy.<br />

Linear algebra offers actually a very elegant framework to model the game. In particular abstract notions, such as the null space of a matrix, can be easily interpreted in terms of the game. An intuitive algorithm coming from this modelling permits to compute all the solutions of the game and to propose the best one, namely the solution with the fewest button presses.<br />

Workshops and talks for high-school students have been created to illustrate how mathematics can be smartly used in order to understand and solve complex problems. We also wrote an article (in French) explaining our workshop; see [Publications](https://fdewez.github.io/publications/).

### Software

The algorithm has been implemented in Java together with an interface permitting to play and to solve the Lights Out. It is available at [https://github.com/Mystelven/LightsOuts-Math](https://github.com/Mystelven/LightsOuts-Math).
